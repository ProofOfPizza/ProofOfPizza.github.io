This is a blog for any sort of nerdery I am interested in. Mainly development related stuff: java, typescript, docker, aws, terraform etc. But other topics such as music theory or math might also come up... who knows ?

I work as a programmer / test automation engineer at [InQuisitive](https://www.inquisitive.nl/). Before this, I used to work as a musician, playing, teaching and composing. It's hard to make a living from music if the music is fun. Boring music makes more money, but hey, then it is better to make money doing something fun like solving problems aka programming.

Feel free to contact me about any of the blogs here, if I can help out I will, and if we're lucky we will all learn something cool. Also if you are interested in my services as a programmer you can of course contact me!

Have fun and stay curious!
